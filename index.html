        <p>
            I'm an innovative and strategy-driven cybersecurity engineer based in Austin, Texas. My focus is on fortifying and transforming complex digital landscapes. I specialize in a multi-disciplinary approach to design and implementation, ensuring that security measures not only protect but also enhance business operations, user experience, and overall system integrity.

            With a deep understanding of cybersecurity principles and best practices, I deliver robust, high-quality, and secure solutions on time. Outside of work, I am passionate about the mountains and the outdoors, and I enjoy biking, climbing, skiing, hiking, and running.
